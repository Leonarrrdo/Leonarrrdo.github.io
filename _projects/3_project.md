__Contribution:__
* Developed the orbit interception strategy and unfolding control scheme for each satellite in TSNR according to fuel consumption, location error and actuator capability, to meet real-world engineering conditions.
* Designed a cross-platform based high-fidelity simulation system, significantly enhancing the simulation efficiency of TSNR and making it more in tune with the real world.
* Analysed the feasibility of the technical route in practical engineering and prepared the project application.
