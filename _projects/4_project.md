__Aims:__ To build a ground-based experimental system for a variety of satellite objects, such as single satellite, tethered
space robot, triangle tethered formation system, etc., to further validate the control algorithms proposed by the
group.

__Contribution:__
* Designed a measuring system for the air bearing table, a control system for satellite simulators, and a tether stabilization release and recovery control system, completing serial communications between different ground experimental systems.
* Conducted ground experiments to validate various formation control schemes of space rigid-flexible robots.
