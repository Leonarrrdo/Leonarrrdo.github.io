	abstract = {The traditional control methods for Tethered Space Net Robot (TSNR) typically treat the tension force induced by the net as a disturbance and employ passive suppression for compensation. However, these approaches overlook the intrinsic nature of the net dynamics. When one Maneuverable Unit (MU) maneuvers, it generates a tension force on the net that is transmitted to other MUs. This force not only affects the control accuracy of other MUs but also has a positive effect. In this paper, an active tension force control strategy is proposed to reveal this kind of interaction and maximize its advantage. Specifically, a neutral network estimator is designed to capture the hysteresis relationship in which MUs influence each other by transmitting forces through the net. Furthermore, to achieve the cooperative completion of tasks, a game control framework is established to optimize the control input and tension force collectively. Through prediction and optimization, MUs actively manage their impacts on each other, thereby actively controlling the influence of tension force on the tracking errors of others. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

	abstract = {The Tethered Space Net Robot (TSNR) is an innovative solution for active space debris capture and removal. Its large envelope and simple capture method make it an attractive option for this task. However, capturing maneuverable debris with the flexible and elastic underactuated net poses significant challenges. To address this, a novel formation control method for the TSNR is proposed through the integration of differential game theory and robust adaptive control in this paper. Specifically, the trajectory of the TSNR is obtained through the solution of a real-time feedback pursuit-evasion game with a dynamic target, where the primary condition is to ensure the stability of the TSNR. Furthermore, to minimize tracking errors and maintain a specific configuration, a robust adaptive formation control scheme with Artificial Potential Field (APF) based on a Finite-Time Convergent Extended State Observer (FTCESO) is investigated. The proposed control method has a key advantage in suppressing complex oscillations by a new adaptive law, thus precisely maintaining the configuration. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}
