    - title: Game Theory based Control Method for Multi-Agent Systems
      year: 2022.09 - now
      description: 
        - Master Thesis
        - Aimed to explore in depth the interactions among agents in a multi-agent system, and then to design controllers by combining data-driven approach, game theory and formation control method, enhancing the capability of multi-agent systems.
        - Developed a pursuit-evasion game to obtain the trajectory of the multi-agent system in the face of a dynamic target, and designed a robust adaptive control with artificial potential field to minimize tracking errors and maintain specific configurations.
        - Proposed a novel formation control scheme that integrates data-driven approaches for modeling agent interactions and cooperative game frameworks for controlling satellites based on their coupled relationship.
        - Published one journal article and one conference article by applying the proposed algorithm to tethered space net robot, and wrote a grant proposal by extending the proposed algorithm to satellite cluster.

      description: 
        - Bachelor Thesis
        - Aimed to design motion planning approaches and formation control schemes for multiple UAVs, enabling them to collaborate in transporting payloads via tethers.
        - Investigated system dynamics model to reduce planning variables and expand the motion range of each UAV, then proposed a novel path planning algorithm to obtain smooth, collision-avoidance trajectories of UAVs for cooperative transportation.
        - Examined reinforcement learning based path planning scheme as a local planner to handle dynamic environmental changes, and proposed an intelligent fault-tolerant control algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to address the case of actuator failure.
